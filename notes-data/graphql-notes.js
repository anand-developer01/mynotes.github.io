$> npm install graphql@14 express-graphql @graphql-tools/schema 

    -> graphql: the JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL. 

    -> express-graphql: HTTP server middleware for GraphQL.

Resolvers are a collection of functions that generate a response for the GraphQL server. Each resolver function has four parameters:

args: Any GraphQL arguments provided to the field. 

context: State shared between all resolvers, often a database connection. 

info: Additional information.
