                    text1: `<b>1. LTO (Lease-To-Own)</b>:
Lease-To-Own (LTO) is a type of financing option that allows consumers to lease a product with the option to own it after completing a series of payments. It's a flexible alternative to traditional credit or financing that typically doesn't require a large upfront payment.

How it works:
-> Customers pay for the item over time through periodic payments (usually weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly).
-> At the end of the leasing period, customers have the option to purchase the product by paying a nominal "buyout" fee or by completing the lease payments.
-> If the customer doesn't complete the purchase, they may return the product or continue leasing it.

Common Uses:
-> LTO is commonly used for durable goods like electronics, furniture, appliances, and jewelry.
-> It's often used by consumers who may not have access to traditional credit or prefer not to use credit for large purchases.

<b>2. RISA (Retail Installment Sales Agreement)</b>:
A Retail Installment Sales Agreement (RISA) is a financial contract that allows consumers to purchase goods and pay for them in installments over time. Unlike leases, a RISA typically involves the customer buying the product outright with the understanding that they will make periodic payments (e.g., monthly) for the duration of the agreement.

How it works:
-> The customer agrees to make fixed payments over a specified period of time, usually with interest.
-> The retailer provides the product to the customer at the point of sale, and the customer owns the product once the agreement is signed, even though they haven't paid the full amount yet.
-> The payments can be made monthly or through other agreed-upon schedules.

Common Uses:
-> RISAs are typically used for higher-value items like furniture, appliances, electronics, or vehicles where the customer might not be able to afford the full purchase price upfront.
-> Key Differences Between LTO and RISA:
-> Ownership: With LTO, the customer generally leases the product with an option to own it at the end of the lease period, while with RISA, the customer immediately owns the product but agrees to make installment payments.
-> Payment Flexibility: LTO may offer more flexibility in terms of returning the product if the customer decides not to purchase it. In contrast, RISA usually does not offer the option to return the product unless the customer defaults on the payments.

Interest and Fees: RISAs typically involve an interest rate on the remaining balance of the product, whereas LTO agreements can sometimes have higher fees or interest rates due to the flexibility they offer.`,

                    text1: `When preparing for an interview involving Playwright, a popular tool for automating web applications and end-to-end testing, you can expect questions that assess both your knowledge of Playwright and general testing principles. Here’s a list of possible Playwright interview questions, broken down into categories:

Basic Playwright Knowledge
What is Playwright?

Playwright is an open-source automation library for end-to-end testing of web applications. It supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and offers rich features like intercepting network requests, generating screenshots, and simulating user interactions.

How does Playwright differ from Selenium?

While Selenium is widely used for automating browsers, Playwright is designed to be faster, more reliable, and capable of automating multiple browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox) with a single API. Playwright also provides more features out of the box like capturing screenshots, recording videos, and more robust browser interaction (e.g., multiple contexts).

What browsers are supported by Playwright?

Playwright supports Chromium, WebKit (Safari), and Firefox.

What are the key features of Playwright?

Cross-browser testing (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox)

Automated screenshots and screen recordings

Network interception and mocking

Simulating multiple devices and geolocation

Headless browser support

Handling pop-ups, alerts, and navigation events

Custom wait mechanisms (e.g., wait for elements, navigation)

Playwright API Questions
What is browser.newContext() used for?

browser.newContext() creates a new browser context. A context is like an isolated session, where cookies, storage, and other browser data are kept separate from other contexts. It’s useful for scenarios like simulating multiple users or testing in incognito mode.

How do you handle file uploads in Playwright?

Playwright allows handling file uploads by setting the file path for the input element in the form.

await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', 'path/to/file');
What is the purpose of page.waitForSelector()?

page.waitForSelector() waits for an element to appear in the DOM before performing actions on it. This is essential for ensuring the element is present before interacting with it (e.g., clicking a button).

await page.waitForSelector('.button');
await page.click('.button');
How do you handle network requests in Playwright?

You can intercept network requests and responses with Playwright’s route feature. This allows for mocking responses or manipulating requests.

await page.route('**/api/**', (route) => {
  route.fulfill({
    status: 200,
    contentType: 'application/json',
    body: '{"message": "success"}'
  });
});
Test Automation Concepts
What are Playwright Test Fixtures?

Playwright Test Fixtures are reusable pieces of code that help set up the state for tests (like opening a browser, logging in, or setting up mock data) and can be shared between tests.

How do you run Playwright tests in parallel?

Playwright supports parallel test execution out of the box using Playwright Test Runner. You can configure the number of parallel workers in the playwright.config.js file.

test('test 1', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
});

test('test 2', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com/another-page');
});
You can also set workers to control the level of parallelism.

How do you run Playwright tests headlessly?

Playwright runs in headless mode by default, meaning it doesn’t display a browser window. However, you can explicitly set it with the headless option.

const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({ headless: true });
Explain the role of test.beforeAll() and test.afterAll()?

These hooks are used to set up or clean up resources before or after all tests in a test suite.

test.beforeAll(): Executes once before the first test.

test.afterAll(): Executes once after the last test.

How do you use Playwright’s locator API?

The locator API allows you to target elements more efficiently than using page.$() or page.$$().

const button = page.locator('button#submit');
await button.click();
Advanced Playwright Topics
What is Playwright's headless mode?

In headless mode, Playwright runs the browser without a graphical user interface (GUI), which is useful for automation tasks, continuous integration, and faster tests.

How do you handle pop-ups or modals in Playwright?

Playwright automatically handles pop-ups (like alerts and dialogs). You can listen for events like dialog to interact with them:

page.on('dialog', async dialog => {
  await dialog.accept(); // Accept the dialog
});
How do you test mobile devices using Playwright?

You can simulate mobile devices by using the device option provided by Playwright, which mimics real mobile behaviors (like viewport size and touch events).

const iphone = playwright.devices['iPhone 12'];
await page.emulate(iphone);
What is the context in Playwright, and how do you use it?

A browser context allows multiple independent sessions (like multiple users) within the same browser instance. Each context has its own cookies, storage, and cache.

const context = await browser.newContext();
const page = await context.newPage();
Playwright vs. Other Testing Tools
What are the advantages of Playwright over Selenium and Cypress?

Speed: Playwright tends to be faster because it uses native browser interactions and provides better support for headless browsers.

Cross-Browser Testing: Playwright supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, allowing cross-browser testing.

Native Mobile Support: Playwright supports testing on mobile devices out of the box.

Network Interception: Playwright provides better support for network request interception and manipulation.

Parallel Execution: Playwright can run tests in parallel more easily compared to Selenium or Cypress.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Playwright
How do you use Playwright with BDD frameworks like Cucumber?

Playwright can be used alongside Cucumber.js to run behavior-driven tests. You can write features in Gherkin syntax and map them to step definitions in JavaScript using Playwright to interact with the web.

Performance and Troubleshooting
How do you capture performance metrics with Playwright?

Playwright provides access to performance metrics through the page.metrics() method, which gives you details about the page’s performance.

How do you debug Playwright tests?

You can use Playwright's built-in debugging tools like page.pause() to pause test execution at a certain point and inspect the state of the page.

await page.pause();  // This will pause the test execution for interactive debugging

A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It's not a finished piece of code, but a template or blueprint for how to solve a particular design issue in different situations.

Key Points:
    Design patterns <b>represent best practices</b> refined through experience.
    They <b>speed up development</b> by providing proven development paradigms.
    They <b>promote code reusability, scalability, and maintainability</b>.
    They are <b>language-independent</b>—though their implementations may differ.

     Categories of Design Patterns:
    <b>Creational Patterns</b> – Object creation mechanisms.
        Examples:
            <b>Singleton</b> – Ensure a class has only one instance.
            <b>Factory Method</b> – Delegate object creation to a subclass.
            <b>Builder</b> – Build complex objects step-by-step.
            <b>Prototype</b> – Clone existing objects.

    <b>Structural Patterns</b> – How objects and classes are composed.
        Examples:
            <b>Adapter</b> – Bridge between incompatible interfaces.
            <b>Decorator</b> – Add behavior without altering original class.
            <b>Facade</b> – Simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

    <b>Behavioral Patterns</b> – How objects interact and communicate.
        Examples:
            <b>Observer</b> – Notify many objects about state changes.
            <b>Strategy</b> – Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors.
            <b>Command</b> – Encapsulate a request as an object.

                    Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test high-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user's requirements.

SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users requirements. In this article we will see Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in detail.

What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process.  

<b>Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle</b>
SDLC specifies the tasks to be performed at various stages by a software engineer or developer. It ensures that the end product is able to meet the customer's expectations and fits within the overall budget. Hence, it's vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this software development process. SDLC is a collection of these six stages, and the stages of SDLC are as follows:

Hence, it's vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this software development process. SDLC is a collection of these six stages, and the stages of SDLC are as follows:

<b>Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis</b>
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 
The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. The quality of the project is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

<b>Stage 2: Defining Requirements</b>
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 

<b>Stage 3: Designing Architecture</b>
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 
This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.

<b>Stage 4: Developing Product</b>
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations. 

<b>Stage 5: Product Testing and Integration</b>
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 
Documentation, Training, and Support: Software documentation is an essential part of the software development life cycle. A well-written document acts as a tool and means to information repository necessary to know about software processes, functions, and maintenance. Documentation also provides information about how to use the product. Training in an attempt to improve the current or future employee performance by increasing an employee's ability to work through learning, usually by changing his attitude and developing his skills and understanding. 

<b>Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products</b>
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product's supervision. `,

    Example: You wrote "I am i good in english" → Correct: "Am I good in English?" or "Do you think I’m good at English?"

    Practice forming complete questions and statements with correct word order.

<b>2. Vocabulary & Expressions</b>
    Your words are understandable, but they’re often basic or direct.
    Expand with synonyms and natural phrases.
    Example: Instead of "keep flowers", say "place flowers" or "offer flowers".

<b>3. Tenses & Consistency</b>
    Sometimes you mix present and past tense.
    Example: "I came back he is not responding" → "I came back, but he wasn’t responding."

<b>4. Polishing for Formal/Professional Use</b>
    Use polite connectors and transitions, especially for work or interviews.
    Example: Instead of "What can fill here", use "What should I fill in here?".

<b>5. Listening & Speaking Practice</b>
    Watch English shows, YouTube explainers, and TED Talks with subtitles.
