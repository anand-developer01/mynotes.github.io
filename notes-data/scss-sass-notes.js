          text1: `SCSS, short for "Sassy Cascading Style Sheets," is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making it easier and more efficient to write and maintain stylesheets. 

          <b>What it is</b>: SCSS is a language that compiles into CSS, allowing developers to use features not directly available in standard CSS. 
Key Features:
<b>Variables</b>: Store values (like colors or fonts) that can be reused throughout the stylesheet. 
<b>Nesting</b>: Organize styles logically by nesting selectors, mirroring the structure of HTML. 
<b>Mixins</b>: Create reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in multiple places. 
<b>Functions</b>: Perform calculations and other operations on CSS values. 
Why use it? SCSS streamlines the process of writing and maintaining stylesheets, leading to cleaner, more organized, and easier-to-manage code. 


<b>How Does Sass Work?</b>
Sass works in such a way that when you write your styles in a .scss file, it gets compiled into a regular CSS file. The CSS code is then loaded into the browser.

That is why it's called a Preprocessor.

<b>Why should you use Sass?</b>
<b>Easy to learn</b>: If you are familiar with CSS already, then you'll be glad to know that Sass actually has a similar syntax, and so you can start using it, even after this tutorial ;)

<b>Compatibility</b>: It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.

<b>Saves time</b>: It helps reduce the repetition of CSS, because of its powerful features.

<b>Reusable code</b>: Sass allows for variables and chunks of code (mixins) that can be reused over and over again. This helps you save time and makes you able to code faster.

<b>Organized Code</b>: Sass helps keep your code organized by using partials.

<b>Cross Browser Compatibility</b>: Sass gets compiled into CSS and adds all the necessary vendor prefixes so you don't have to worry about manually writing them out.



CSS Preprocessors compile the code which is written using a special compiler. They then use that to create a CSS file, which can then be referenced by the main HTML document.

When using any CSS Preprocessor, you will be able to program in normal CSS just as you would if the preprocessor were not in place. The good thing is you also have more options available to you. Some, such as SASS, has specific style standards which are meant make the writing of the document even easier, such as the freedom to omit braces if you want.

Of course, CSS Preprocessors also offer other features as well. Many of the features offered are incredibly similar across preprocessors, with only slight variances in syntax. Thus, you can choose pretty much any one you wish, and you will be able to achieve the same things. Some of the more useful features are:

          text1: `Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think youâ€™ll want to reuse. Sass uses the <b>$</b> symbol to make something a variable. 

          You can declare variables in Sass. This is one of Sass's strengths since we can define variables for various properties and use them in any file.
The benefit here is that if that value changes, you simply need to update a single line of code.
This is done by naming a variable with a dollar symbol <b>$</b> and then referencing it elsewhere in your code.
          
          When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the <b>$font-stack</b> and <b>$primary-color</b> and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.`,

          When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.

Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.

          text1: `This is one of the many awesome features of Sass that gives you an advantage.

          You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like <b>_partial.scss</b>. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the <b>@use</b> rule.

As stylesheets grow large over time, it gets difficult to maintain them. Because of this, it just makes sense to break your stylesheets into smaller chunks. In other words, Partials help you organize and structure your code.

To declare a partial, we will start the file name with an underscore <b>_</b>, and add it in another Sass file using the <b>@import</b> directive.

For example, if we have a <b>_globals.scss, _variables.scss</b>, and <b>_buttons.scss</b>, we could import them into the main SCSS file <b>main.scss</b>.

@import "globals";
@import "variables";
@import "buttons";
You'll notice that the underscore and the <b>.scss</b> are not added. That is because Sass automatically assumes that you are referring to the <b>.sass</b> or <b>.scss</b> file.`,

          You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the <b>@use</b> rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its <b>variables, mixins</b>, and <b>functions</b> in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. 
          
          Notice we're using <b>@use 'base';</b> in the <b>styles.scss</b> file. When you use a file you don't need to include the file extension. Sass is smart and will figure it out for you.`,

          In SCSS, mixins allow you to create groups of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the stylesheet. This can be helpful when working with vendor prefixes, complex animations, and other code that might need to be used in multiple places.

          A <b>mixin</b> in SCSS is a <b>block of reusable CSS code</b> that you can "include" in any selector. Think of it like a function in programming: you write it once and use it wherever you need.

          <b>Why use Mixins?</b>
Avoid code duplication
Encourage modularity and reusability
Prevent deep and complex inheritance trees

To create a mixin you use the <b>@mixin</b> directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin <b>theme</b>. We're also using the variable <b>$theme</b> inside the parentheses so we can pass in a <b>theme</b> of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with <b>@include</b> followed by the name of the mixin.
